{NS}
Okay so for this next one it should be a little more interesting.
{NS}
Um.
{NS}
So this one is gonna be reading sentences that are on the screen um.
{NS}
And let me just get it set up here.
{NS}
Yeah.
{NS}
Yeah do you need anything?
{NS}
No.
{NS}
Did you have Lucy's as well?

XXXXX
XXXXX

{LG}
We stayed in multiple places.
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
Yeah and we did.
So San Francisco to LA that's ten hours.
Yeah that's seven and I think we did another seven.
We stopped in Tuscon so we did like LA to Tuscon.
And then we actually went to Marfa in West Texas.
Oh did you go to the Marfa lights?
Yeah yeah it was kinda cool.
We heard about it from actually.
Did you see any lights?
No no I mean we saw a lot of New Yorkers.
{LG}
I know.
{LG}
You can roll your eyes at that.
It seemed like that a little bit.
I realized that the people that told us about it are also from New York.
{LG}
I was like huh.
So they all went to see the Marfa lights.
Yeah yeah.
They also have like the fake Prada store in the middle of nowhere and.
I don't know.
They had some cool art.
Anyway.
Yeah.
I'm getting off topic slightly.
Yeah I haven't been there in a while.
{LG}
I went on Valentine's day.
Yeah.
{NS}
I went to take her to the Marfa lights.
I heard it was uh.
The story that I've heard for the Marfa lights were from the.
You alright over there?
You okay?
{LG}
He's like you're putting me to sleep.
{LG}
Aw.
{LG}
I'll tell you the story afterwards.
OK.
Sounds good.
Alright.
So I'm going to try to put this on your sleeve.
{LG}
Uh.
Yeah.
He's falling asleep.
Yeah.
{LG}
No I'm not.
{LG}
He's like no no no.
Um.
So we can do this.
You can hold it you'd like and I can wipe it off with something if you'd like.
Or you could just put it right there.
Yeah I can put it here.
Can you actually get it there?
Read aloud the sentence that appears on the screen then click next.
Okay.
Yeah that works.
So.
Although actually.
Well let's try it let's see how this works.
So what's going to happen is you're going to read the sentence aloud then you're gonna hear it played back to you.
So you'll hear what you said played back.
Okay.
{NS}
What if I put it here?
{NS}
And I'm going to move some other stuff around.
What I usually do is shove these over a little bit but.
We have some extra setup here.
{NS}
I think that's good enough.
Is that legible?
Like you can read it from here?
Think.
{NS}
Oh.
I think he's spiking.
Yeah was that are you.
Is he spiking or is that from me moving the electrodes?
I think from you moving that thing.
{LG}
It might be from me moving it cause he.
Yeah no.
If I touch them.
{NS}
I have no clue.
Then it could be that.
Did you feel anything.
No.
No?
Do you usually have an aura before you have a seizure?
Uh no.
Okay.
Not anymore.
Sometimes like he spikes.
Mhm.
But it doesn't doesn't um.
Doesn't notice necessarily?
Well doesn't go into a full tonic-clonic.
Yeah.
Well there's spikes that he'll go through.
Sometimes he'll show like he's spiking and then and then it'll go away.
Okay.
Huh.
They're like auras but I don't think he knows it's an aura.
I think he can't.
Or it's like not as obvious that something's about to happen.
Yeah?
You want to keep going?
Is that what the nod is?
{LG}
Yeah.
Alright let's try this.
Um.
Alright.
{NS}
