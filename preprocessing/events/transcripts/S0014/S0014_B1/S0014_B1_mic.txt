{LG}
It's weird isn't it?
It sounds so much different than how I hear myself.
Yeah I think that's definitely a very common thing because also when we are hearing ourselves talk it's going through our bones too.
Like actually in your skull so you can hear it actually resonate there um.
But yeah there's all sorts of stuff going on there with that.
That's kind of what we're interested in too, so.
