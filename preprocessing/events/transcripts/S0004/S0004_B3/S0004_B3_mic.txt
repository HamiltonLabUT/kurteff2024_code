Alright!
Thank you.
May I ask.
Is it like trying to see if she repeats what she's saying or reading?
So it's supposed to look at the difference between when she is hearing the same thing that she said versus where she hears a different thing.
Oh okay.
Yeah cause for some of them you heard exactly what you said right?
Uh repeated back.
And then for other ones it was a different type of sound.
And so there's that mismatch there.
Oh okay.
Um.
Yeah so.
